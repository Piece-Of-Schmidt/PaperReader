#### Methodology

The authors present the Inflation Perception Indicator (IPI), a new metric developed to quantify media coverage of inflation in Germany based on a substantial corpus consisting of approximately three million articles from three major newspapers: *Süddeutsche Zeitung*, *Die Welt*, and *Handelsblatt*, spanning from January 2001 to February 2022. This study employs **RollingLDA**, a dynamic topic modeling method that allows for the identification of evolving themes within the corpus over time, effectively refining the traditional Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) approach, which is generally static.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset includes a cleaned corpus emerged from a filtering process that retains articles relevant to inflation. An issue-specific analysis corpus of 50,495 articles was created.
2. **Dynamic Topic Modeling (RollingLDA)**: The authors employ RollingLDA to allow the model to adapt as new data is introduced, capturing changes in public narratives surrounding inflation. This is achieved through a method referred to as “seeding,” where the model's architecture can evolve based on earlier modeling.
3. **Identification of Narratives**: The authors qualitatively analyze topics derived from the LDA output, framing these narratives through elements such as problem definitions, moral judgments, protagonists, and events.

Through this method, the IPI provides a continuously updated view of inflation narratives in the media, allowing for monitoring changes over time.

#### Results

1. **Narrative Framework**: The authors identified ten distinct themes related to inflation. Notably, several themes are associated with:
   - **Central Banks**: Discussions largely focus on the European Central Bank (ECB) and their monetary policy.
   - **Raw Materials**: Increased attention to raw material prices, especially linked to global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian-Ukraine conflict.
   - **Consumer Perspectives**: Inflation is portrayed as a serious issue impacting savers and consumers, with a growing emphasis on wage demands and their potential implications on inflation.

2. **Temporal Patterns**: The analysis reveals distinct peaks in media reporting correlating with significant economic events (e.g., financial crises, post-pandemic recovery). The IPI indicates that media attention often aligns closely with actual inflation trends but diverges during periods of economic stability when inflation rates are low.

3. **Framing of Causes and Consequences**: Key causes attributed to inflation include:
   - Central bank policies 
   - Fiscal measures
   - Raw material prices

The consequences are mostly viewed negatively, with narratives highlighting that inflation can expropriate wealth from savers and negatively impact consumers.

4. **Shift in Perception**: The findings suggest a notable shift in the public narrative surrounding inflation within the observed timeframe, emphasizing a potential resurgence in conversations about wage demands—a factor that had not been prominently addressed in Germany for many years.

#### Relation to Other Research

The results of this paper contribute to and echo several existing strands of literature exploring how media shape economic perceptions and narratives. Previous studies have established a link between media coverage and public expectations regarding inflation (e.g., Doms and Morin 2004; Lamla and Lein 2014), demonstrating that heightened media attention corresponds with shifts in consumer sentiment. Similarly, the notion of narrative economics, as posited by Shiller (2017), supports the idea that collective beliefs, fostered through media narratives, can profoundly impact economic expectations and decisions.

Moreover, the study indicates that narratives, shaped by media, can act as significant conduits for monetary policy transmission, paralleling findings from Berger et al. (2011) which argue that media functions as an essential tool for communicating central bank intentions and policy measures to the public. Furthermore, the RollingLDA methodology introduced aligns with broader calls for dynamic modeling in economic narrative analysis, as evidenced in the recent work by Tuckett and Nikolic (2017), emphasizing the role of narratives in economic decision-making under conditions of uncertainty.

In conclusion, Müller et al.'s paper provides valuable insights into the evolving narratives surrounding inflation in Germany, illustrating the importance of understanding media frameworks as a lens through which economic phenomena are interpreted and acted upon by the public. The results could inform future research and central bank communications approaches, especially in contexts of heightened inflation volatility.
